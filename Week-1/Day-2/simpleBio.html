        <p>Full Stack Junior Developer searching for a group where I can further enhance my developing skills. Computers have always fascinated me, finally something that I have full control of! I previously worked as an Orthodontic Assistant, where I was intrigued by watching the mechanical process of changing someones smile. I appreciated being able to share my ideas with the Orthodontist. Each Orthodontic case was different, it involved a lot of critical thinking and problem solving. I decided to move forward with becoming a developer because it is a great opportunity to work independently. I knew that I would enjoy the challenges and possibilities that would come with it. Growing up, I was always the one called to fix a computer, jail break a phone or install programs. I look at programming as an art, you can be as creative as you want without any limits and create it on a screen, watch it function the way you want and lastly feel that you can command anything you want from it.
